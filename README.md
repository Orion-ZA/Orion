## 🌱 Branch Workflow

1. `main` $\rightarrow$ always stable and production-ready.
2. `dev` $\rightarrow$ active development branch.
3. **Feature branches** for individual tasks:
```bash
feature/your-name-task
bugfix/your-name-issue
```
4. Open Pull Requests into `dev` for review before merging.

## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

- Commit small, clear changes with descriptive messages.
- Never push directly to `main` — always use PRs.
- Link commits/PRs to related issues.
- Keep code style consistent (follow project linter/formatting rules).

## 📅 Project Management

We track tasks and progress using:
- GitHub Projects (Kanban board)
- GitHub Issues (for bugs and features)
