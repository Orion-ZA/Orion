## 🛠 Tech Stack

🚧 Work in progress

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: Firebase
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Docker
- **Tools**: GitHub, Discord
- **Testing**: Jest

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
In terminal in desired dest:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Orion-ZA/Orion
cd Orion
```
# Install Node 20 and use it
nvm install node (latest version)
nvm use node (latest version)

# Verify version
node -v (should be 24.X)
nvm -v (should be 10.X or higher)

# Install dependencies
npm install 

# Start server
npm start

### 2. Create your branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-name-task
```

## 🌱 Branch Workflow

1. `main` $\rightarrow$ always stable and production-ready.
2. `dev` $\rightarrow$ active development branch.
3. **Feature branches** for individual tasks:
```bash
feature/your-name-task
bugfix/your-name-issue
```
4. Open Pull Requests into `dev` for review before merging.

## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

- Commit small, clear changes with descriptive messages.
- Never push directly to `main` — always use PRs.
- Link commits/PRs to related issues.
- Keep code style consistent (follow project linter/formatting rules).

## 📅 Project Management

We track tasks and progress using:
- GitHub Projects (Kanban board)
- GitHub Issues (for bugs and features)
- Discord (daily team communication)

### React Set-up

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
